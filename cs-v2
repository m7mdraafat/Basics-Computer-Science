### _From "Ana mesh fahem 7aga" to "I'm ready for at least internship interviews" in ~1-2 years_

> **Welcome!** 👋
> You opened this probably thinking "CS is hard w keda" — and honestly? You're right. BUT! With the right roadmap, study partner 😉, some koshary breaks, and a lot of coffee (or shai b laban), you'll make it. I promise. Yalla beena

## Who Is This For?
- You just entered CS faculty and have **zero clue** what's happening
- Your professor speaks in Assembly and you're still on "Hello World!"
- You heared "Data Structures" and thought it's about building furniture
- You want a job at FAANG but can't even center a div (relatable 😭)
- You don't understand previous joke, exactly you don't know what I meant by `center div`
